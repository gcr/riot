;; Queue would be responsible for
;; - generating a UUID for this director node
;; - Gathering data about each client
;; - Ensuring the server is still alive, expiring "dead" workunits
;;   with the UUID
;; - Saving workunit results from clients and relaying them
;;   back to the server
;; - Serializing (require racket/serialize) parameters and results
;;   using fasl

;; Maybe use web-server/lang/serial-lambda ?
